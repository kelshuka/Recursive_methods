Fibonacci Sequence: 
The fibonacci sequence is such that the next number is the sum of the two preceeding numbers. Here, the sequence starts from 0.
E.g fibs(8) = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13].

mergeSort:
sorts an array by recursing through the data using sub-sets until it reaches the smallest unit, which is a single item.
